								<h2>1.Anemia</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Anemia is a condition in which you don't have enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to the body's tissues. Having anemia may make you feel tired and weak.</p>

							<p><strong>CAUSES-</strong>Anemia occurs when your blood doesn't have enough red blood cells. This can happen if:
                            Your body doesn't make enough red blood cells
                            Bleeding causes you to lose red blood cells more quickly than they can be replaced
                            Your body destroys red blood cells</p>

							<p><strong>SYMPTOMS-</strong>Anemia signs and symptoms vary depending on the cause of your anemia. They may include:
                            Fatigue,Weakness,Pale or yellowish skin,Irregular heartbeats,Shortness of breath,Dizziness,Chest pain,Cold hands and feet,Headache.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            	<h2>2.Endometriosis</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which tissue that normally lines the inside of your uterus — the endometrium — grows outside your uterus. Endometriosis most commonly involves your ovaries, fallopian tubes and the tissue lining your pelvis.</p>

							<p><strong>CAUSES-</strong>Retrograde menstruation. In retrograde menstruation, menstrual blood containing endometrial cells flows back through the fallopian tubes and into the pelvic cavity instead of out of the body. 
                            Transformation of peritoneal cells. In what's known as the "induction theory," experts propose that hormones or immune factors promote transformation of peritoneal cells — cells that line the inner side of your abdomen — into endometrial cells.
                            Surgical scar implantation. After a surgery, such as a hysterectomy or C-section, endometrial cells may attach to a surgical incision.</p>

                            Fatigue,Weakness,Pale or yellowish skin,Irregular heartbeats,Shortness of breath,Dizziness,Chest pain,Cold hands and feet,Headache.</p>

                            	<h2>3.Stress</h2>
							<p>Stress is your body’s way of responding to any kind of demand or threat. When you sense danger—whether it’s real or imagined—the body’s defenses kick into high gear in a rapid, automatic process known as the “fight-or-flight” reaction or the “stress response.”</p>

							<p><strong>CAUSES-</strong>Common external causes of stress include:Major life changes,Work or school,Relationship difficulties,Financial problems,Being too busy.Common internal causes of stress include:Pessimism,Inability to accept uncertainty,Rigid thinking, lack of flexibility,Negative self-talk,Unrealistic expectation.</p>


							<p><strong>SYMPTOMS-</strong>Memory problems,Inability to concentrate, Depression or general unhappiness,Anxiety and agitation, Aches and pains,Diarrhea or constipation,Nausea, Dizziness.</p>
                            <br>
                            	<h2>4.Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</h2>
							<p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS may have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods or excess male hormone (androgen) levels. The ovaries may develop numerous small collections of fluid (follicles) and fail to regularly release eggs.</p>

							<p><strong>CAUSES-</strong>The exact cause of PCOS isn't known. Factors that might play a role include:Excess insulin. If your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, then your blood sugar levels can rise and your body might produce more insulin. Excess insulin might increase androgen production, causing difficulty with ovulation.Low-grade inflammation:This term is used to describe white blood cells' production of substances to fight infection.Heredity:Research suggests that certain genes might be linked to PCOS.Excess androgen:The ovaries produce abnormally high levels of androgen, resulting in hirsutism and acne.</p>


							<p><strong>SYMPTOMS-</strong>Irregular periods. Infrequent, irregular or prolonged menstrual cycles are the most common sign of PCOS. For example, you might have fewer than nine periods a year, more than 35 days between periods and abnormally heavy periods.Excess androgen. Elevated levels of male hormone may result in physical signs, such as excess facial and body hair (hirsutism), and occasionally severe acne and male-pattern baldness.Polycystic ovaries. Your ovaries might be enlarged and contain follicles that surround the eggs. As a result, the ovaries might fail to function regularly.</p>
                            <br>

							<p><strong>SYMPTOMS-</strong>Painful periods (dysmenorrhea). Pelvic pain and cramping may begin before and extend several days into a menstrual period. You may also have lower back and abdominal pain.Pain with bowel movements or urination. You're most likely to experience these symptoms during a menstrual period.Excessive bleeding. You may experience occasional heavy menstrual periods or bleeding between periods (intermenstrual bleeding).Infertility. Sometimes, endometriosis is first diagnosed in those seeking treatment for infertility.</p>
