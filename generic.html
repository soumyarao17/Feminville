								<h2>1.Anemia</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Anemia is a condition in which you don't have enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to the body's tissues. Having anemia may make you feel tired and weak.</p>

							<p><strong>CAUSES-</strong>Anemia occurs when your blood doesn't have enough red blood cells. This can happen if:
                            Your body doesn't make enough red blood cells
                            Bleeding causes you to lose red blood cells more quickly than they can be replaced
                            Your body destroys red blood cells</p>

							<p><strong>SYMPTOMS-</strong>Anemia signs and symptoms vary depending on the cause of your anemia. They may include:
                            Fatigue,Weakness,Pale or yellowish skin,Irregular heartbeats,Shortness of breath,Dizziness,Chest pain,Cold hands and feet,Headache.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            	<h2>2.Endometriosis</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which tissue that normally lines the inside of your uterus — the endometrium — grows outside your uterus. Endometriosis most commonly involves your ovaries, fallopian tubes and the tissue lining your pelvis.</p>

							<p><strong>CAUSES-</strong>Retrograde menstruation. In retrograde menstruation, menstrual blood containing endometrial cells flows back through the fallopian tubes and into the pelvic cavity instead of out of the body. 
                            Transformation of peritoneal cells. In what's known as the "induction theory," experts propose that hormones or immune factors promote transformation of peritoneal cells — cells that line the inner side of your abdomen — into endometrial cells.
                            Surgical scar implantation. After a surgery, such as a hysterectomy or C-section, endometrial cells may attach to a surgical incision.</p>


							<p><strong>SYMPTOMS-</strong>Anemia signs and symptoms vary depending on the cause of your anemia. They may include:
                            Fatigue,Weakness,Pale or yellowish skin,Irregular heartbeats,Shortness of breath,Dizziness,Chest pain,Cold hands and feet,Headache.</p>
                            <br>
                            	<h2>3.Stress</h2>
							<p>Stress is your body’s way of responding to any kind of demand or threat. When you sense danger—whether it’s real or imagined—the body’s defenses kick into high gear in a rapid, automatic process known as the “fight-or-flight” reaction or the “stress response.”</p>

							<p><strong>CAUSES-</strong>Common external causes of stress include:Major life changes,Work or school,Relationship difficulties,Financial problems,Being too busy.Common internal causes of stress include:Pessimism,Inability to accept uncertainty,Rigid thinking, lack of flexibility,Negative self-talk,Unrealistic expectation.</p>


							<p><strong>SYMPTOMS-</strong>Memory problems,Inability to concentrate, Depression or general unhappiness,Anxiety and agitation, Aches and pains,Diarrhea or constipation,Nausea, Dizziness.</p>
                            <br>
                            	<h2>4.Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</h2>
							<p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS may have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods or excess male hormone (androgen) levels. The ovaries may develop numerous small collections of fluid (follicles) and fail to regularly release eggs.</p>

							<p><strong>CAUSES-</strong>The exact cause of PCOS isn't known. Factors that might play a role include:Excess insulin. If your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, then your blood sugar levels can rise and your body might produce more insulin. Excess insulin might increase androgen production, causing difficulty with ovulation.Low-grade inflammation:This term is used to describe white blood cells' production of substances to fight infection.Heredity:Research suggests that certain genes might be linked to PCOS.Excess androgen:The ovaries produce abnormally high levels of androgen, resulting in hirsutism and acne.</p>


							<p><strong>SYMPTOMS-</strong>Irregular periods. Infrequent, irregular or prolonged menstrual cycles are the most common sign of PCOS. For example, you might have fewer than nine periods a year, more than 35 days between periods and abnormally heavy periods.Excess androgen. Elevated levels of male hormone may result in physical signs, such as excess facial and body hair (hirsutism), and occasionally severe acne and male-pattern baldness.Polycystic ovaries. Your ovaries might be enlarged and contain follicles that surround the eggs. As a result, the ovaries might fail to function regularly.</p>
                            <br>
                            	<h2>5.Osteoarthritis</h2>
							<p>Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. It occurs when the protective cartilage on the ends of your bones wears down over time.Although osteoarthritis can damage any joint in your body, the disorder most commonly affects joints in your hands, knees, hips and spine.</p>

							<p><strong>CAUSES-</strong>Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage that cushions the ends of bones in your joints gradually deteriorates.Cartilage is a firm, slippery tissue that permits nearly frictionless joint motion.
                            In osteoarthritis, the slick surface of the cartilage becomes rough. Eventually, if the cartilage wears down completely, you may be left with bone rubbing on bone.</p>


							<p><strong>SYMPTOMS-</strong>Osteoarthritis symptoms often develop slowly and worsen over time. Signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis include:
                            Pain. Your joint may hurt during or after movement.
                            Tenderness. Your joint may feel tender when you apply light pressure to it.
                            Stiffness. Joint stiffness may be most noticeable when you wake up in the morning or after a period of inactivity.
                            Loss of flexibility. You may not be able to move your joint through its full range of motion.
                            Grating sensation. You may hear or feel a grating sensation when you use the joint.
                            Bone spurs. These extra bits of bone, which feel like hard lumps, may form around the affected joint.</p>
